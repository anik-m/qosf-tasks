While both are CSS codes that correct a single arbitrary error, they have significant differences in their construction and operation:\n","\n","* **Qubit Cost:** The Steane code is more efficient. It achieves the *same* goal (protecting 1 logical qubit from 1 error) using **7 qubits**, while the Shor code requires **9 qubits**.\n","* **Construction:**\n","    * **Shor:** A **concatenated code**. It's a \"code within a code.\" It uses an *outer* 3-qubit phase-flip code to protect against $Z$ errors, and *inner* 3-qubit bit-flip codes (the repetition code from Task 2) to protect against $X$ errors.\n","    * **Steane:** A **non-concatenated code**. Its stabilizers for $X$ and $Z$ errors are more deeply integrated and are derived from the parity check matrices of the classical [7,4,3] Hamming code.\n","* **Syndrome Measurement:**\n","    * **Shor:** Simpler, but more numerous. It uses 6 ancillas for 3 separate 2-bit $X$-error syndromes (one for each 3-qubit block) and 2 ancillas for one 2-bit $Z$-error syndrome.\n","    * **Steane:** More complex, but consolidated. It uses 3 ancillas to get a single 3-bit $X$-error syndrome and 3 ancillas for a single 3-bit $Z$-error syndrome.\n","* **Correction Logic:**\n","    * **Shor:** Correction is two-staged. You first fix $X$ errors *within* each 3-qubit block. Then you fix $Z$ errors *between* the logical blocks.\n","    * **Steane:** The 3-bit $Z$-syndrome maps directly to the qubit with an $X$ error. The 3-bit $X$-syndrome maps directly to the qubit with a $Z$ error. It's a more direct lookup table.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"l7RwhRBeEX-a"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","### What challenges have you detected in the process of building the error-correcting codes?\n","\n","We encountered several critical (and realistic) challenges during this process. The bugs we found are the most common and frustrating ones in QEC simulation:\n","\n","1.  **Mismatched Circuits (The 50% Error Bug):** The most significant challenge. The `encoder`, `syndrome`, and `decoder` functions *must* be mathematically precise partners. If the decoder isn't the *exact inverse* of the encoder, or if the syndrome logic measures stabilizers for a *different* code, the ideal (noiseless) run fails with a ~50% error rate. The circuit just scrambles the data.\n","\n","2.  **Register Scoping (The \"No Correction\" Bug):** The `qc.if_test()` function in Qiskit 1.x operates on the classical registers *owned by the circuit*. If the `if_test` accidentally references a *global* register variable instead of the circuit's internal register (`qc.cregs[i]`), the condition will *always* be false, and no correction is ever applied, even when syndromes are measured correctly.\n","\n","3.  **Corrupted Ancillas (The \"Worse Error\" Bug):** In our first repetition code test, our noise model applied errors to *all* qubits, including the ancillas. This corrupted our syndrome measurement itself, causing the code to apply \"corrections\" for errors that didn't exist, actively making the logical error rate *worse* than doing nothing.\n","\n","4.  **Flawed Correction Logic (The \"Still Worse Error\" Bug):** A simple copy-paste or logic error in the syndrome-to-qubit mapping (e.g., mixing up the corrections for syndromes `01` and `10`) causes the circuit to apply the *wrong* fix, which is just as bad as (or worse than) no correction.\n","\n","5.  **Code-Specific Blindness:** Realizing that the 3-qubit repetition code is fundamentally \"blind\" to $Z$ errors. This highlights that a code must be specifically designed to handle all potential error types ($X$, $Z$, and by extension, $Y$).\n","\n","6.  **Qiskit 1.x Syntax:** The move from the simple `.c_if()` method to the `with qc.if_test():` block syntax was a recurring hurdle that required updating all classical-feedforward logic."],"metadata":{"id":"oNR1DvpoFQVl"}}]}
